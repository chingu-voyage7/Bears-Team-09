## Project Description

PairUp is an web application that helps to find like minded people who want to do certain activities together. If Meetup.com is about meeting and discussing various topics of interest, PairUp is about **doing** activities together. If you are looking for people in your city to learn chess together, start a jogging group or start a amateur soccer team - PairUp is for you.
